# 🎬 Movie Search Application

A modern React-based movie search application that allows users to discover and search for movies using the TMDB API. The application features a clean, responsive design with real-time search functionality and trending movies section.

## 🎓 About This Project

This project was created as part of my journey to learn React.js. As my first React project, it helped me understand fundamental concepts like:
- Component-based architecture
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- API integration
- State management
- Modern React practices

Through building this application, I gained hands-on experience with React development while creating something practical and useful.
